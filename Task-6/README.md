### <span style="color:LightSkyBlue"> **Theme** : </span>
This is a travel blog of a passionate and adventurous traveller. The main idea behind this website is to share **my travel experiences, offbeat travel ideas, travel itineraries, and travel tips** with the travel enthusiasts out there. 

### <span style="color:LightSkyBlue"> **Motivation**  : </span>
Travelling around the world has always helped me to understand more about different cultures, traditions and lifestyle of different people. Moreover, it has helped me to understand and find myself. My main motto behind this website is to inspire people to live a life they love. 

### <span style="color:LightSkyBlue"> **Future Improvements** : </span>
I am really looking forward to add more travel experiences and tips to the blog.  Also, please do suggest the improvements needed in the comment section.

**Thank you for reading**
